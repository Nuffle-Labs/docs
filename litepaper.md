## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem, there is an increasing demand for secure, fast and trustless cross-chain interoperability. With the proliferation of diverse blockchain networks, each with its own unique features and capabilities, the ability to seamlessly interact and exchange value across these platforms has become a crucial necessity. Furthermore, as chain abstraction helps the ease of use of blockchain technologies and blurs the lines between different blockchain networks, it is utmost important to provide a safety mechanism that does not comprimise the fast interaction between different networks.

Nuff protocol is fast cross-chain interactions through dynamically adjusted crypto-economic security that solves addresses these problems.

In this paper we introduce a novel approach to fast cross-chain interactions through dynamically adjusted crypto-economic security.

## Problem Statement

As new blockchain networks and n-layer solutions on top of existing networks emerge in an incredible pace, users are faced with an increasingly difficult user experience. Users are asked to maintain different wallets, assets on different chains, use different bridging solutions and face many more user experience problems. 

On top of this, every security domain has a different objectively attributable truth. For users to interact with more than one security domain, users are expected to abide to the rules of the security domain that they are operating in. This introduces significant user experience problems in terms of latency and asynchronity (is that a word?).

As the number of interactions and number of technologies increase, the possible attack surfaces also increase. It is unreasonable to expect users to asses the risks of the underlying platforms that they use every time that they interact with a new system.
